    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Follow our simple step-by-step guide to rolling your own, low-fat and healthy Japanese sushi!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 nori sheets</li>
        <li>100g skinless salmon fillet (use really fresh), thinly sliced lengthways</li>
        <li>¼ cucumber, deseeded, thinly sliced lengthways</li>
        <li>squeeze wasabi, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>pickled sushi ginger, to serve</li>
        <li>light soy sauce, to serve</li>
        <li>salmon roe, to serve (optional)</li>
        <li>100g sushi rice</li>
        <li>2 tsp saké or mirin (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp caster sugar (omit if using mirin)</li>
        <li>25ml rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, make the rice. Rinse the sushi rice in a colander, massaging it with your hands until the water runs clear. Leave to drain for 15 mins.</li>

        <li>Put the rice in a saucepan with 200ml water and the sake or mirin, if using. Bring to the boil, then cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 mins until the liquid is absorbed. Remove from the heat. Set aside, covered, for 15-20 mins.</li>

        <li>Transfer to a large bowl. Dissolve the sugar, if using, in the vinegar with a good pinch of salt, pour over the rice and mix. Cover with a damp tea towel and set aside at room temperature until ready to use.</li>

        <li>Put 1 nori sheet on a bamboo mat and cover the surface with half of the cooled rice. Lay half of the salmon and cucumber slices along the length of the rice in a strip, being careful not to overfill it. Run a pea-sized blob of wasabi (more if you like it really hot) along the edge of the filling with your finger.</li>

        <li>Roll up tightly and squeeze to seal when you reach the end. Repeat with the remaining nori, salmon and cucumber, and more wasabi. Slice each roll into 6 pieces, and serve with extra wasabi, ginger, soy sauce and salmon roe, if you like. Will keep in the fridge for 1 day.</li>
    </ol>
